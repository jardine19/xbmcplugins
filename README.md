## EE TV for XBMC 

Notes
* this has only been tested on the versions of XBMC/Kodi I have installed so may not worked on the latest version
* On your EE TV box turn on the option which says you are using the EETV App otherwise you'll get errors when your box enters standby.
* Where you have multiple variations of the same channels (e.g. BBC ONE East Midlands and BBC ONE E Yorks and Lincs) you will get the varient on the correct channel number (e.g. if BBC ONE East Mids is on 1 you'll get that when selecting BBC ONE Yorks and Lincs)

## Installation
* On your PC or Laptop (or even better your Kodi box)
* Go To https://github.com/kevjs1982/xbmcplugins/tree/master/repository.kevjs1982 
* Click on the latest Zip File (e.g. repository.kevjs1982-1.1.zip)
* Click the Raw button
* Save the downloaded file to somewhere accessible from inside Kodi
* On your Kodi Box (the exact wording depends on your Kodi version and Skin)
* System
* Settings
* Add Ons
* Install from Zip File
* Browse to the repository.kevjs1982-1.1.zip file you downloaded earlier and select it
* - It will now download and install

* EE TV
* Install
* When it's installed, ensure it's enabled then select the Configure option
* Enter the IP Address of your EETV Box (Note, ideally you want to setup your router to issue the EE TV Box with the same IP Address each time)
